# To setup keywords

    1. Navigate to the Extensions tab via Add-ons and themes menu from the settings or simply type `about:addons` in the search bar

    2. Choose the content-web-blocker extension and click on Preferences

    3. In the text box enter a list of blocked keywords separated by a comma.
        Example : 
            ```
                boo,moo,poo
            ```
        The keywords are case insensitive so Boo,bOo, bOO, BOO are all the same as boo
